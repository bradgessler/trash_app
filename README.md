Learning SwiftUI by trying to build out a `WebView("https://www.google.com/")` view component that I can plugin into the built-in SwiftUI `NavigationView`. The closest component I could find that does this is https://github.com/kylehickinson/SwiftUI-WebView, but it navigates within WKWebView. I want a component with less state then that; specifically I want it such that when a link is clicked on my `WebView` component, it doesn't actually navigate to the new URL. Instead the state of the `WebView` component should trigger a URL change that can be picked up by SwiftUI and acted upon. For this particular project, when a user clicks on a link, I want to push a new `WebView` component into the `NavigationView` stack.

This repo doesn't quite do that yet. If you watch [this movie](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bradgessler/JXaUDf9aM9Kz5UqVwjMKkSgE4fdhIUWwkw781p1Oe4Vhio4W3gDKpdiiB9j2xZLjAFGrXvckwMY0ji82QKSmXoG0PtZ1BftrnOX1.mov) you'll see when I click on the "Load next page" button, the `NavigationView` controller is used. When I click on a link, its not used. I'd like to intercept these clicks to push the new view onto the `NavigationView` stack.

The goal *after* this excercise is to learn how SwiftUI and WKWebKit work together to make a powerful MIT licenses SwiftUI `WebView` component that others may use in their projects (sadly https://github.com/kylehickinson/SwiftUI-WebView is not MIT licenses, and the maintainer hasn't responded to the ticket to release it under such a license).
